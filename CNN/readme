Start.py -> prepares data for training by reshaping in required format and splitting in two parts namely training and testing.

model -> provides directory of images to strat.py -> makes model using keras and tensorflow -> training done using data obtained from start.py -> saves trained model for further used

model2 -> same as model1 but modified (all chages can be obsereved between line 28 and 41)

model3, model4-> same as model 2

slider -> tests saved model on a image
